# Technology

To develop this machine learning model we use Convolutional Neural Network algorithm first we try some algorithm and found the best model by using InceptionV3 as transfer learning. We also use google collab notebook and some python library in this project, including tensorflow, matplotib, numpy, keras, pathlib etc. After training model we tried saved model h5 and tensorflow lite format, but we after found our best model we decide saved our model to
